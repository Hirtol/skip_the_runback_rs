# Skip the Runback

Simple utility for saving player coordinates, and teleporting to them, in order to avoid the runback in Soulslike games

## How to Use

Use `F9` to save your current position.

Use `F10` to teleport to it, make sure you're in the same world-space (general vicinity) of your saved waypoint.
